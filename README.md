This repository provides all the codes and sources used for the development of the article titled **"Estudo de inferência causal sobre a maximização preditiva do índice de satisfação dos usuários no Airbnb"**, written in june, 2023.

This project is meant to describe the correlation of some features in an acommodation that are key to a high-level user experience. Based on this information, a maximization problem is defined in order to find out what values for each variable determine a maximum satisfaction rate in reviews on the platform. Plus, it is explained why a good experience is important, what consequences are caused by the review and which variables matter the most for the prediction.

To further understanding, read the whole article and try exploring these codes. To run, it is important to unify them into one.
