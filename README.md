This repository provides all the codes and sources used for the development of the article titled **"Estudo de inferência causal sobre a maximização preditiva do índice de satisfação dos usuários no Airbnb"**, written in june, 2023.

This project is meant to describe the correlation of some features in a acommodation that are key to a high-level user experience. Based on this information, a maximization problem is defined in order to find out what values for each variable determines a maximum satisfaction rate in reviews on the platform.
